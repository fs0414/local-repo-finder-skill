  Fast detection of local Git repository paths.
  Use when referencing another repository or absorbing directory layout differences between developers.
  Triggers on requests like "find repository", "locate repo", "repository location", "search path", "reference another repository".

# Local Repository Finder

A skill for fast detection of specified Git repository paths in local environments.
Absorbs different directory structures across developers and enables shareable workflows.

## When to Use

- When you want to reference another repository from SlashCommand or AgentSkills
- When you want to reference local-specific paths from team-shared resources
- When you want to automate cross-repository tasks

## Prerequisites

`fd` command is required (approximately 30x faster than `find`).
```bash
# macOS
brew install fd

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install fd-find

# Arch Linux
pacman -S fd
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Repository Name

Confirm the repository name the user wants to reference.

### Step 2: Detect Path

Search for `.git` directories using the following command to get the repository root path.
```bash
fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "<REPO_NAME>$" | head -1
```

Replace `<REPO_NAME>` with the actual repository name and execute.

### Step 3: Store as Variable

Save the detected path to a variable for use in subsequent tasks.
```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "<REPO_NAME>$" | head -1)"
```

## Command Reference

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `fd` | Fast alternative to find command |
| `-H` | Include hidden files/directories in search |
| `"^\.git$"` | Exact match for `.git` name (regex) |
| `~/` | Start search from home directory |
| `-t d` | Search directories only |
| `2>/dev/null` | Suppress error output |

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Detect hogerepo repository
fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "hogerepo$" | head -1
# => /Users/username/dev/work/hogerepo

# Work with detected path
REPO_ROOT="/Users/username/dev/work/hogerepo"
cat "${REPO_ROOT}/package.json"
ls "${REPO_ROOT}/src/"
```

### Usage in SlashCommand
```markdown
## Phase 1: Repository Detection

Identify target repository with the following command:

fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "target-repo$" | head -1

Use detected path as `TARGET_ROOT` for subsequent tasks.

## Phase 2: File Reference

- Entry point: `${TARGET_ROOT}/src/main.ts`
- Config file: `${TARGET_ROOT}/config/default.json`
```

### Detecting Multiple Repositories
```bash
# Show all matches when multiple exist
fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "api$"

# Narrow down with more specific pattern
fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "project-a/api$" | head -1
```

## Fallback

Use `find` if `fd` is not installed (approximately 30x slower):
```bash
find ~/ -type d -name ".git" 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "<REPO_NAME>$" | head -1
```

## Performance

| Command | Execution Time | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| `fd` | ~2.4s | Fastest, recommended |
| `find` | ~1m 19s | About 32x slower than fd |
| `ghq list` | ~1m 50s | Environment dependent, slowest |

## Boundaries

### DO NOT

- Do not search from outside home directory (e.g., `/`)
- Do not modify files in detected paths without permission
- Do not output credentials or `.env` file contents

### ASK FIRST

- When multiple repositories match, confirm which one to use
- Confirm before modifying files in detected repositories

## Troubleshooting

### fd: command not found
```bash
# Check installation
which fd || which fdfind

# On Ubuntu it may be fdfind
alias fd=fdfind
```

### Repository not found
```bash
# Search with partial match
fd -H "^\.git$" ~/ -t d 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} dirname {} | grep "<PARTIAL_NAME>"
```
